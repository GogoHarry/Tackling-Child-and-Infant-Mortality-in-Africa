## Introduction
Child and infant mortality remain pressing public health challenges in Africa. This project explores critical factors influencing mortality rates, identifies trends, and proposes actionable strategies to mitigate preventable deaths. By leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, the project contributes to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: Good Health and Well-being.

## Problem Statement
Despite global progress, African nations face disproportionately high under-five mortality rates due to:
- Inadequate healthcare access
- Low vaccination coverage
- Socioeconomic disparities
- Regional inequalities
This project provides data-driven insights to identify at-risk populations, understand contributing factors, and inform resource allocation.

## Objectives
1. Analyze Trends: Identify historical patterns in child and infant mortality.
2. Investigate Contributing Factors: Assess socioeconomic, healthcare, and environmental determinants.
3. Develop Predictive Insights: Build models to identify high-risk regions and key mortality drivers.
4. Propose Solutions: Recommend strategies for improving maternal healthcare and vaccination coverage.

## Data Sources
The analysis is based on multiple datasets, including:
1. **Youth Mortality Rates:** Mortality rates for individuals under 15 years old.
2. **Number of Infant Deaths:** Annual infant mortality statistics by country.
3. **Child Mortality by Income Level:** Mortality rates across different economic tiers.
4. **Maternal Deaths by Region:** Data on maternal health outcomes.
5. **Global Vaccination Coverage:** Immunization coverage by disease.
6. **Births Attended by Skilled Staff:** Percentage of births assisted by healthcare professionals.
7. **Health Protection Coverage:** Population covered by health insurance.
8. **Causes of Death in Children Under Five:** Major contributors to child mortality.


## Tools and Libraries
The following tools and Python libraries were utilized for the analysis:
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas
- Visualization: Geospatial analysis and data visualization techniques
- Predictive Models: Feature importance to identify mortality drivers

## Project Workflow
**1. Data Collection and Cleaning**
  - Loaded datasets from multiple sources
  -  Conducted inspection for missing values, duplicates, and data consistency
  -  Addressed null values and ensured readiness for analysis

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

  - Visualized mortality trends across regions and income levels
  - Analyzed relationships between mortality rates, healthcare access, and vaccination coverage
  - Highlighted disparities across geographic and socioeconomic groups

**3. Predictive Modeling**
  - Built models to predict high-risk regions for mortality
  - Used feature importance analysis to identify key contributing factors

**4. Results and Insights**
  - Revealed high mortality rates in low-income countries with gaps in healthcare and immunization
  - Identified maternal health and vaccination coverage as significant predictors of child survival

## Results
Key findings include:
1. Mortality Disparities: Higher mortality rates were observed in low-income regions with limited access to skilled healthcare providers.
2. Vaccination Gaps: Countries with low vaccination rates recorded higher child mortality.
3. Maternal Healthcare: Improved maternal care (e.g., births attended by skilled staff) strongly correlates with reduced infant deaths.
4. Key Drivers: Socioeconomic status, healthcare coverage, and immunization remain critical factors.

## Actionable Recommendations
**1. Increase Vaccination Coverage:**
  - Expand immunization programs to remote and underserved areas.
  - Implement mobile health clinics to reach marginalized communities.

**2. Improve Maternal Healthcare:**
  - Train and deploy skilled healthcare professionals for antenatal care and childbirth.
  - Strengthen maternal education on child nutrition and hygiene.

**3. Enhance Healthcare Access:**
  - Increase health protection coverage to ensure affordability and accessibility.
  - Promote public-private partnerships for healthcare infrastructure development.

**4. Target High-Risk Regions:**
  - Focus resources on low-income and rural areas with elevated mortality rates.
  - Use predictive insights for targeted interventions.

## Future Work
  - Data Integration: Incorporate real-time health data for better monitoring and analysis.
  - Advanced Modeling: Explore machine learning techniques for mortality prediction.
  - Policy Evaluation: Assess the impact of implemented interventions over time.
  - Cross-Sector Collaboration: Include education, nutrition, and sanitation sectors in future analyses.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of data-driven strategies in combating child and infant mortality across Africa. By addressing healthcare access, vaccination gaps, and maternal health, significant progress can be made toward achieving SDG 3. Policymakers, healthcare providers, and stakeholders are encouraged to adopt these actionable insights to foster healthier communities.
